This room focuses on teaching the basics of assembly through reverse engineering


Task 2: crackme1


We can solve task2 via many  process like strings command , ltrace ,strace or r2 


            ------------------ 1st Process Via strings command  -----------------


Step 1 : Download target file and  check file format via  file  command 


Step 2:  Target file bin format  so ,  target file execution file  


Step 3: Use strings  command and  analyze file content
             Command:
                               strings crackme1.bin


Step 4: After , analyze content of file via strings  command  we got password of crackme1.bin
            File like this  ha***


          ----------------- 2nd Process Via ltrace command --------------------


Step 1: Change permission of target file via chmod command .
           Command :
                              chmod  +x crackeme1.bin
Step 2: Open target file  Via ltrace command 
            Commnad:
                             ltrace  ./crackeme1.bin
  

Step 3: Then , enter some  strings and see output properly you will get strcmp for comparing         two variable 


Step 4: After all , we get password of our target file like this ha***
 
   
Task 3 : crackme2


Step 1: Download target file and analize via file, strings ,ltrace command


Step 2 : After using previous command like strings ,ltrace,strace we couldn’t find any password
             For target file .
Step 3: As we couldn’t find any password  we tried another process via “ghidra “ Reverse               Engineering Tools .


Step 4: Open Target file via “ghidra “ and go to main function of target file


Please , if you  have no knowledge about uses of ‘ghidra tools’  you  must learn first  how to use “ghidra “ >> It is so easy and so important tools for Reverse Engineering :)


Step 5 :See at decompile part of “ghidra “ and you  will find like this “ if (local_14 == 0x137c)"
  



Step 6: Convert 0x137c into decimal you will get the password of the target file .


Password :49**


Task 4 :crackme3


Step 1 : Download  target file and try previous process for find out the password of target file


Step 2 : Via previous process we couldn’t find password of  Target file so try another process .


Step 3: Open target file  Via r2 (radere 2 ) command.
           R2 -d crackme3.bin


Step4 : Use basic Command of  Radare 2 :
                                                                     1.aaa  ------------for analyze all 
                                                                     2.afl    ------------for see all function list in target file
                                                                     3.pdf  @main --- for print disassembly main function


Step 5: After complete ,above all step we will see like this :
               


Hare, symbolic letters are the first three letters of password 


Password:  “azt123”


Note : You can also get password via Break point
